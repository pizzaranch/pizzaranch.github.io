## seriously nerdy


[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) - lets you set up multiple instances of a language model to work together (e.g. copywriter / editor / proofreader)
 
[langchain](https://python.langchain.com/)  Langchain is a system for encoding our own documents and data and keeping them internal. Then we can control how much access a model has to our stuff, or even run our own model internally
 
[TextCortex](https://textcortex.com/) - swiss army knife type solution for connecting an AI model to our stuff. I haven’t looked into this one too far
 
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)  this is the one I mentioned that lets you use any of the major models through an API interface.
 
[openrouter and langchain explainer](https://medium.com/@gal.peretz/openrouter-langchain-leverage-opensource-models-without-the-ops-hassle-9ffbf0016da7) on medium.  using openrouter to power a langchain-connected bot
 
[MS AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-with-copilot)  - Microsoft has some of its AI services available through Power Automate, an app we already have in our Office suite.  Or we could use an openrouter connection with it.  Still digesting this and trying to understand what I’ll need Kyle’s approval for
 
[Voice Flow](https://www.voiceflow.com/) - as I understand it, this one is a system to answer customer service calls and route the user to solutions, including automatic ones
 
[ollama](https://ollama.com/) - run several different open-source LLMs locally
 
[unriddle](https://www.unriddle.ai/) - chat with a document
 
[Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/) - AI voices (aka half of Youtube now)
 
[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) - a custom search that you can set up with our own internal documents for customer service type things or maybe searching RanchNet
 
[Literally Anything](https://www.literallyanything.io/)   and     [replit](https://replit.com/)- two of a hundred different “no code” tools to build a web app. They all make clunky, junky web apps that drive me crazy, but it’s good for who it’s for
