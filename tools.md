* [Open Llama](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama) - an open source platform for running models locally
* [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) - lets you set up multiple instances of a language model to work together (e.g. copywriter / editor / proofreader)

* [TextCortex](https://textcortex.com/) - swiss army knife type solution for connecting an AI model to your stuff. 
* [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) - gives you API access to multiple LLMs on a pay-as-you-go basis
* [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) - a custom search that you can set up with our own internal documents for customer service type things or maybe searching RanchNet
* [Literally Anything](https://www.literallyanything.io/)   and     [replit](https://replit.com/) - “no code” web app builders
* [Bland](https://www.bland.ai/) - an outbound AI agent that can make calls for you.
