# Harnessing AI - Links and resources from the talk

## Links to the major services

* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai/)
* [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (uses GPT as its language model)
* [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) 
* [Claude](https://claude.ai)

## other handy tools and resources

* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - remembers basic facts about you, gives you access to multiple premium models, and let's you store contexts for later re-use. I have several different "collections" in Perplexity that each have their own context prompt so i don't have to type all that in every time.
* [Pi](https://pi.ai/) - a personal assistant for advice, answers, and organization. I like to use Pi for anything that involves a longer conversation. It's just better at that than a lot of the other models, and--at least for now--it's free.
* [Poe](https://poe.com/) - similar functionality where you can choose from several models
* [Google Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) let's you upload documents to summarize and ask questions about
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) do data anlytics with an AI assistant to help with what you don't already know

## even more

Here are [a whole bunch of AI services and ideas](tools.html), if you want to dig even deeper.

One of the first times I interacted with ChatGPT, I had [Charles Dickens write about Bitcoin](bitcoin.html) and I thought it was kind of brilliant.

## Example prompts we used in the talk

Here are the prompts we used, in case you want to try them or modify them for your needs.

### Director of Communications
> you are Director Of Communications for Pizza Ranch, a pizza and chicken buffet in Peoria, IL (obviously this is to be replaced with your location). Your task is to craft statements for our social media presence. When prompted to create a statment, always follow these guidelines
> 
> ask questions to clarify until you understand the task
> 
> * keep the tone light and conversational
> * do not use big words
> * do not use silly or slang words
> * responses should be kept to about 3 or 4 sentences unless otherwise instructed
> * end with the phrase "God Bless"
 

### Practicing active listening skills

> act as my conversation partner. You are a customer at the buffet restaurant that I manage
>
> Give me a scenario where i can practice active listening skills. Provide a dialog with someone speaking, and I'll respond with active listening responses to demonstrate that I understand their points. Let me know if I can do something better or more smoothly

### Write Better Emails

> rewrite the following email to be more concise, polite, and to-the-point without altering the core meaning.
 
### Learn Spanish Better

> you are a spanish teacher attempting to coach me in beginning and low-intermediate spanish.  
> 
> Read the article at the link. Then pick out the following:
> 
> * 5 to 10 common words used in the article. List these along with their english translations
> * 5 to 10 commonly used phrases. List these phrases along with their english translations
> * 5 to 10 instances of irregular verbs. List the word in spanish as it is used, the infinitive of the word, and its english translation
> 
> Here is the article:  https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/c51nnddz72go

### Organize your emails

This works in Google Gemini IF you use gmail and IF you allow Gemini to look at your email through its extensions. There are lots of ways to expose your email to an LLM. Just be careful of privacy concerns.  Once the LLM can see your emails, you can use a similar prompt to this.

> I'd like a summary and any suggested actions for each email in my inbox received since [Date]

### Manage Your Time

There's no magic to this prompt. But notice how we're referencing how it should look at the question (through the teachings of Cal Newport, David Allen, Greg Keown, etc) and telling it what role or walk of life to apply those ideas to.

> how can i use cal newport's ideas  for getting organized in my role as a general manager?

You could replace the expert with anyone who has a significant body of work in any field: Stephen King, Yogi Berra, Billy Graham, Hulk Hogan, etc. 

### Parker saying "lol"

> My Co-worker Parker uses odd words like "lmao" and "lol" and "afaik". Is he having a stroke?

In case you're curious, here's what perplexity told me using GPT 4o as a model:

> Your co-worker Parker is not having a stroke; he is simply using common internet slang abbreviations. Here are the meanings of the terms he is using:
> 
> [...]
> 
> These abbreviations are part of the evolving language of digital communication and are widely used by people to convey emotions and reactions quickly and efficiently.
